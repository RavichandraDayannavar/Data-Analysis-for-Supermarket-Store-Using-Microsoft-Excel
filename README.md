Welcome:
Freshco Hypermarket, a prominent supermarket in HSR Layout, Bangalore, has been a trusted name in the community for its exceptional service and wide-ranging product offerings. To meet the evolving needs of its customers, Freshco launched a home delivery service in 2021. This project explores transactional data to uncover key insights that can drive better customer experiences and operational efficiency.

üìå Key Insights:
- Order Completion Trends : 
The majority of orders are successfully completed, indicating a well-functioning delivery operation. However, specific time slots and delivery areas show slight dips in completion rates, highlighting opportunities for improvement.
- Customer Loyalty Patterns:
Customers acquired in the first quarter of the year tend to have higher engagement and repeat orders, suggesting the effectiveness of promotional strategies during this period.
- Revenue Drivers:
High-value customers account for a significant portion of revenue. Retention strategies targeting these customers could maximize lifetime value and profitability.
- Delivery Area Dynamics:
Certain delivery areas experience higher order volumes, particularly during peak evening hours, emphasizing the need for resource optimization in these zones.
- Time Slot Preferences:
Evening and night slots dominate order placement, indicating a preference for convenience after work hours. Late-night orders, though fewer, show higher completion rates due to reduced traffic and optimized routing.

üõ†Ô∏è How This Helps:
- Operational Insights: Identify underperforming areas and time slots to optimize resources and streamline deliveries.
- Customer-Centric Strategies: Leverage customer behavior patterns to tailor promotions and improve loyalty.
- Growth Opportunities: Focus on high-value customers and under-served areas to boost revenue and engagement.
